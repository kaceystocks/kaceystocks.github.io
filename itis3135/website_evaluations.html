            <h4>Poorly Designed Website - <a href="https://craigslist.org/" target="_blank" >craigslist</a></h4>
            <p>Craigslist is an online classifieds website where users can post and browse listings for jobs, housing, services, items for sale, and community events. It has been around since the mid-1990s but has not significantly updated its design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Very minimal; the site uses mostly plain text and links without clear hierarchy, making it visually unappealing.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Inconsistent; while the basic layout repeats, font sizes and spacing feel outdated and uncoordinated.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Poor; many sections are simply text links stacked together without strong alignment cues, giving a cluttered appearance.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Weak; related elements are not always grouped together clearly, which makes navigation confusing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, Craigslist does not follow the CRAP principles well. While functional, its outdated and cluttered design makes it difficult to navigate and visually unappealing.

            <h4>Well Designed Website - <a href="https://more-nutrition.webflow.io/" target="_blank">More Nutrition</a></h4>
            <p>More Nutrition is a modern website for a nutrition brand, showcasing its products with a clean layout, strong visuals, and clear calls to action. It uses professional design principles to guide the user experience.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Excellent; the site uses bold colors, large headings, and high-quality images to clearly separate elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Strong; consistent fonts, colors, and button styles reinforce branding throughout the site.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Very good; grids and spacing create a professional, balanced layout thatâ€™s easy to follow.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Effective; related content is grouped logically, making it easy to find information and products.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Overall, More Nutrition follows the CRAP principles very well. Its design is visually engaging, consistent, and user-friendly, making it easy for visitors to explore the brand and products.
